This is my JavaScript Portfolio - A work in progress

I've decided to rebuild my portfolio, so please bear with me while I add things in. Some of them were projects that I've done before that I want to improve upon, some I want to build anyway. It will be modest at first, but it will become something wonderful... Stay tuned!

One note to make is that I tend to focus more on the data and funcitonality rather than the aesthetics. I know what looks good and doesn't, but I may not have the best colour scheme or font.

Realized that I hadn't pulled before I merged, so I forced the push on GIT. Still making sure that I know what I'm doing, and still learning. Here's a summary of what I have as of today:

Fibonacci Project: I was told that someone at one of the companies that I was looking at always asked about this sequence and no one knew what it was. I knew right away. I have built the basic sequence, but will eventually put a front end on it at some point.

HTML/CSS: I'm going back through some of my previous projects and decided to rebuild them from scratch based on the principles in each of the projects or what I was learning. I've now got two projects in here: band and responsive. These aren't meant to be pretty. They are meant to follow instructions and show a process. Did I do what was being asked of me? Yes. Did I achieve those? Yes. Great.
